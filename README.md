I'm considering to buy a new Mac Mini and I want to know which games I **CANNOT** play on it. Steam has an option to filter games working on Mac OS but not show which games are **NOT** working on Mac OS.

_I wanted to know what I will miss if._

## Requirements

1. **Steam Developer API key:** Get your Steam Developer API key from here: <https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey>. You may require to approve it from two factor authentication. Just press "Approve" on your mobile phone. You can delete it after you're done by one click.
2. Your Steam ID 64: Visit <https://steamid.io/lookup/> and search for your Steam ID, or public profile URL. You will find your ID 64.

## Usage

You need to store your Steam Developer API key and Steam ID 64 in an `.env` file.

```env
API_KEY="your_api_key"
STEAM_ID_64="your_steam_id_64"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Quotes are optional.

I prepared a simple go script to achieve this goal. You can download executable from [Releases](/releases) page. Download the executable, place next to the `.env` file and run it.

```bash
./mynonmacosgames
```

## You are stealing my API key!

No, the executable has generated by github actions, not by me. You can see which code has been executed by clicking the "Actions" tab.

Alternatively, you can run the code yourself. Download the code from [main.go](/main.go) and run it if you have Go development environment.

```bash
go run main.go
```

## How does it work?

The script uses Steam Developer API to get the list of games and their compatibility with Mac OS. It then filters out the games that are compatible with Mac OS and saves the list to a file.
